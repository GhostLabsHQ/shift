    # Shift configuration — https://github.com/GhostLabsHQ/shift
    #
    # The screen's usable area (minus menu bar / Dock) is divided into a grid.
    # A `cell = [x, y, w, h]` is in grid units with a TOP-LEFT origin:
    #   x = columns from the left,  y = rows from the top,
    #   w = width in columns,       h = height in rows.
    #
    # There are two kinds of positions:
    #
    #  • Built-in (Basic Layout + Displays) — baked into the app. You can't add,
    #    remove, or move them, but you CAN change their shortcut in [keybindings]
    #    below (key by `code`; set to "" to unbind, or delete the line to keep
    #    the default).
    #
    #  • Custom — fully yours. Add / edit / remove the [[position]] blocks at the
    #    bottom. Each needs a `code`, a `cell` or `action`, and an optional `key`.
    #
    # Keys: cmd / ctrl / alt(opt) / shift  +  a-z, 0-9, arrows, return, space,
    #       tab, delete, esc, f1-f12, punctuation.   e.g. "cmd+ctrl+left"
    #
    # Edit this file and save — Shift reloads automatically.
